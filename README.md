# CO545-Assessment4-ProdConsProblem
A functional programming assignment in Erlang, around concurrency and the Producer-Consumer problem.

<h1> Aim of assessment </h1>
This assignment was set as a part of our Functional programming and concurrency module. This problem occurs when a producer and a consumer are both trying to perform actions on a shared buffer concurrently. We were then required to solve this problem so the producer will not attempt to add to a full buffer and the consumer will not attempt to take form an empty buffer.

<h1> Mark recieved for assessment </h1>
I recieved 85% for this assessment.
